THE file that describe the instruction of how you can use my code.this file called( README FILE).
STEP FOR STEP OF ACCESS MY CODE.
                     challenge one:
to develop photo responsive gallery :
the code are saved in folder called challenge. the file you access in this folder is INDEX.HTML, and subfolder called images inorder to get photoes.
#the directory of the folder and file are the following: c/users/user/xamp/htdocs/challenge/ files and subfolders.
# to access the my work in web you enter:localhost/challemnge/index.hmtl .
                     challenge two:
                    TO DEVELOP  ARRAY MANIPULATION:
 the task I work file called arrayMap.js where we have array and target, and check if sum of subarray are equal to target.
 so when sum of subarray is equal to target value you  get TRUE. else you get FALSE.
 # For running the this ARRAY MANIPULATION use you open file called arrayMap.js in VS CODE and runn terminal :** PS C:\xampp\htdocs\challenge> node arrayMap.js**

                     Challenge three:
                     string transformation:
  this task when you provide the string that are divisible by 3 you get reverse of those string. when the string divible 5 you get ASCII CODE of those string. and then 
  if length of string divible by both 3 and 5 you get both reverse and ASCII CODE of string.
  the file of this task is called( stringTransform.js)
  # to runn it you open file called stringtransform.js in VS code and then open terminal and runn this:** PS C:\xampp\htdocs\challenge> node stringTransform.js**
